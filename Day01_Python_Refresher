PYTHON - Developed by Guido Van Rossum. It is high level language and case sensitive.

Variables - It is a name given to a memory location in a program.
Keywords - they are reserved words in python.
Data-Types - Integer(int) , Float , Double , String(str)
Type casting - change the data tyes of a variable. Ex : a = 10 , B = str(a) it gives B = "10"

Types of Operator :- Operators are the sybmol that performs a certain operations between operands.
1. Arithmetic Operators ("+","-","/","*","%","**")
2. Relational/Comparision Operators ("==","!=",">","<",">=","<=")
3. Assignment Operators ("=","+=","-=","*=","/=","%=","**=")
4. Logical Operators ("and","or","not")

Control Flow :-
1. if / elif / else - It is used when we have a choise between different conditions either this or that. Example, classiciation of students by grading system.
2. for loops - It is used for sequential traversal. For traversing list , string , tuple ,etc.
3. While loop - it is used when the number of iteration is unknown and depend on a condition.
4. Break - It is used to terminate the loop when encountered .
5. Continue(skip) - It terminates the execution in the current iteration and continue the execution of the loop with the net iteration. 
6. Pass - It is a null statement that does nothing. It is used as a placeholder for future code.

Data Structures :-
1. List - It is an ordered , mutable(changeable) collection that allows duplicate elements.Ex:- [1,2,3,3]
Methods used :- append(),extend(),instert(),remove(),pop(),clear(),sort(),reverse(),count(),index().
2. Tuple - It is an ordered , Immutable collection that allows duplicates.Ex:- (1,2,4,5,4)
Methods used :- count(), index().
3. Dictionary :- It is unordered(in older version), mutable collection of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable and ordered since python3.7+ 
Methods used :- Keys(), value(), items(), get(), update(), pop(), popitem(), clear()
4. Set - It is unordered, mutable collection of only unique elements. Ex:- S = {1,2,3,4} 
Methods used :- add(), update(), remove(), discard(), union(), intersection(), difference(), symmetric_difference().
5. List comprehension - It is a concise way to create new lists by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable.
Syntax:- [expression for item in iterable if condition]

Functions - Block of statements that perform a specific task. we need functions when we do same task multiple times.
Arguments - The values you pass to a function when calling it.
Lambda function - A lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined without a name.Ex :- a = lambda x:x**2 
Recursion - When a function calls itself repeadtly.
